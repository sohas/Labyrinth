# Labyrinth
logical game Laberinth (in progress)

launch from: 
Labyrinth\GameWPF\bin\Debug\net5.0-windows\GameWPF.exe

maps must lay in:
Labyrinth\GameWPF\bin\Debug\net5.0-windows\Maps
(in the repo they are in \Labyrinth\Game\Maps 
and only 2 simple maps present)

you are walking in the labyrinth (puting arrow keys). there are some diodes and holes in the labyrinth. diode is one-way valve. after falling into a hole you get another (defined by hole) labyrinth place. in this case you see new empty start point and all previous routs collected in tabs.
